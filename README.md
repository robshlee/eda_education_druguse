# EDA for Education Outcomes and Drug Use Datasets

This is the second 'project' completed while attending General Assembly's Data Science Immersive program. It went over general EDA and graphically trying to understand data using Pandas.

'project-02-v2-starter-code.ipynb' had the base template for the questions provided by General Assembly and the code written were my resposes. I kept this format for readability purposes.
